Lab Assignment Requirements
==============================

Add AJAX functionality to a working branch; push it to your repo:

1. Create a repo on Github for this project (a NEW ONE) - call it A3_Lab1. Initialize it with a Readme.

2. Using the Github GUI, create a new branch; edit the Readme (add some information about the project); merge the branch to master

3. Copy the repo using the Clone This Repo button

4. Use the Terminal navigate to the htdocs folder on a Mac or the www folder on a PC and clone the repo

5. Create a new working branch (dev.addingAjax)

6. Download and unpack the lab files into this folder

7. Make the AJAX part functional (retrieve the data, populate the elements)

8. Add, commit and push your changes back to the GitHub repo

9. DO NOT merge your changes remotely

10. Give yourselves a pat on the back - you did it!

11. REMOVE YOUR WORKING FILES FROM YOUR LAB COMPUTER (IF USING) AND DUMP THE DATABASE

And send me the link to your repo via FOL
